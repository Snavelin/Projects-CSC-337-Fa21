        <p>One of Chicago's most famous, iconic landmarks was the flagship store of Sears, Roebuck
            and Co., located along State Street, <a href="index.html" title="Home">downtown Chicago</a>.
            The company Sears started as a merger of companies owned by Richard Sears and Alvah
            Roebuck in 1892. Multiple retail stores opened throughout Chicago from 1925 to 1928, with
            the flagship store opening in 1932. Sears and Roebuck wanted to create a shopping experience,
            where everything a consumer could want could be found under one roof.</p>
        <p>From the 40s to the 70s, the Sears chain prospered so well, that it needed to consolidate
            all of its corporate centers. Because Sears was based out of Chicago, it made sense to
            build their unified corporate center in what became known as the <a href="sears-tower.html">Sears Tower</a>.
            In 2009, one of the tower's major tenants, the Willis Group, was able to change the name to
            <a href="willis-tower.html">Willis Tower</a> as part of their lease agreement.</p>
