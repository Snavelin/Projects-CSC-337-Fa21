        <p>The Willis Group Holdings is a global insurance brokerage firm in the midwest.
            They originally leased space in the <a href="sears-tower.html">Sears Tower</a> located
            on the southern edge of the Finance District in <a href="index.html" title="Home">downtown Chicago</a>.
            In 2009, the Sears Tower was renamed the Willis Tower.
            In that year, a new exhibit experience was built on the upper floors: the Skydeck and the
            Ledge, which gave tourists a unique view of Chicago and the surrounding states.
            Although the building retained the name of Willis Tower, the holding group sold it to the
            Blackstone Group for $1.3 billion in 2017. A major redevelopment quickly began in 2018.
            Besides modernization, the goal of the project was to make the building an urban center
            in of itself, combining work and play.</p>
        <p>Who would've thought that a mail order company, <a href="sears-company.html">Sears, Roebuck and Co.</a>, whose only goal
            was to consolidate their corporate offices into one building, could have been the origin
            of such a forward-thinking achievement?</p>
