            <p>Chicago, also known as the Windy City, is famous for its unique skyline, retail center,
                and tourist destinations. The skyline once boasted the tallest building in the world:
                the Sears Tower. In fact, the skyline itself is the second tallest in the United States.
                Since the mid 20s, the Retail District of downtown Chicago was anchored by famous department
                stores, such Sears, Roebuck and Co.</p>
