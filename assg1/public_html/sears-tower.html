        <p>Beginning construction in 1970 and completing four years later, the
            Sears Tower (<a href="willis-tower.html" title="Willis Tower">now Willis Tower</a>) is a 108-floor skyscraper that dominates the Chicago skyline from the southern edge of
            <a href="index.html" title="Home">downtown</a>.
            It surpassed the World Trade Center as the tallest building in the world and kept the
            title until 1998, when it was surpassed by the Petronas Towers.</p>
        <p>It served as the headquarters of the retail company <a href="sears-company.html">Sears, Roebuck and Co.</a>, the tower's namesake, from its opening to 1994.
            As a term of their lease of the building, the Willis Group had the tower's name changed to the
            <a href="willis-tower.html">Willis Tower</a>.</p>
